            <h2>Air Pollution and Malaysia</h2>
            <p>Air pollution is a pressing concern, originating from natural and human sources. Natural sources like sea surface emissions, forested areas, and soil dust contribute to background pollution levels. Human activities such as vehicle emissions, industrial operations, and biomass burning worsen air quality. Since the 19th century industrial era, human-made pollutants have dominated, adversely affecting human health. Disseminating air pollution information to the public and policymakers is crucial.</p>
            <p>Malaysia, located in Southeast Asia, consists of thirteen states and three federal territories. Divided by the South China Sea, it has Peninsular Malaysia with Kuala Lumpur as the capital, and Borneo as the eastern region.</p>

            <h2>Air Pollution in Southeast Asia</h2>
            <p>Southeast Asia, comprising countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore, faces significant air pollution challenges. Rapid urbanization, industrialization, and vehicular emissions are major contributors. Transboundary haze pollution from forest fires in Indonesia also affects neighboring countries. Addressing air quality issues in this region requires coordinated efforts and policies.</p>

            <h2>Tips for Lowering Air Quality Index (AQI)</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Reduce Vehicle Emissions: Opt for carpooling, public transportation, or cycling when possible. Regular vehicle maintenance, such as tune-ups and air filter replacements, can also help reduce emissions.</li>
                <li>Conserve Energy: Use energy-efficient appliances and practices to reduce power plant emissions. Turn off lights and appliances when not in use.</li>
                <li>Minimize Open Burning: Avoid burning waste or agricultural materials openly. Instead, utilize proper disposal methods or consider composting.</li>
                <li>Plant Trees and Vegetation: Trees help absorb pollutants and improve air quality. Support tree planting initiatives and consider planting trees in your surroundings.</li>
                <li>Practice Sustainable Living: Conserve water and reduce waste. Use eco-friendly products and support sustainable practices in your daily life.</li>
                <li>Promote Clean Energy Sources: Advocate for renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. Support policies that encourage the adoption of clean energy technologies.</li>
                <li>Indoor Air Quality: Ensure proper ventilation at home and use air purifiers if necessary. Avoid smoking indoors and minimize the use of harsh chemicals.</li>
                <li>Stay Informed: Stay updated on air quality alerts and follow recommendations from local authorities. Adjust outdoor activities during periods of high pollution.</li>
